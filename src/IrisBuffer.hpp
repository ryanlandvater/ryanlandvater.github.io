 * @brief Private implementation of the reference counted data object used to wrap datablocks.
 *
 * It can either strong reference or weak reference the underlying data.
 * The buffer can also shift between weak and strong referrences if chosen;
 * however, this is very dangerous obviously and you need to ensure you
 * are tracking if you have switched from weak to strong or vice versa.
 *
 * \warning Use of the __INTERNAL__Buffer is given as a courtesy for developers
 * who want greater efficiency and control over datablocks. These methods
 * were created for the internal use by Iris Developers and come with some inherant risk.
 *
 * \warning __INTERNAL__Buffer is currently NOT thread safe. This will be fixed
 * in future updates.
